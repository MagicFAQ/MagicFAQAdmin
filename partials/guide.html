    <h1>User Guide</h1>
    MagicFAQ is our in-house FAQ system. Visitors can search using natural language (conversation English) to find Questions and Answers. The system learns from use, incorporating user feedback and behavior to improve the recommendation algorithm.
    <h2>Websites</h2>
    We have a wordpress plugin, which makes it easy to add MagicFAQ to most UW websites. You can see a primary example of this on the OUR website. MagicFAQ is not supported on any legacy Drupal websites.

    <br/>
    By default, visitors will see a list of the "top" questions as generated by the system. This list may change as visitor searches change.

    When a visitor clicks on a question, it will expand to show the associated answer, as well as a series of options to provide feedback to the system. Visitor feedback is incorporated back into the search algorithm, allowing MagicFAQ to learn over time which searches to associate more strongly with which Q/A pairs.

    <h2>Administration</h2>
    Once we have a copy of MagicFAQ installed and configured for you, all administrative tasks can be done though a dedicated administrative web app. Each instance of MagicFAQ will have it's own control panel.
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    Upon opening the Administrative panel, you'll be greeted by a list of all active questions.

    <br/>
    Clicking on a question will take you to the detail screen. From here you can add recommended terms, see recent searches which have yielded this Q/A pair, and edit the question itself.

    Recent Searches and Recommended Search Terms may look a little strange the first time you see them. The system automatically strips out connector words, and simplifies the text down to a very sparse form of language. This reduced form is best for the search algorithm which powers MagicFAQ.

    &nbsp;
    <h4>Adding New Questions</h4>
    Adding a new Question / Answer pair is a simple process. Click the "Create a Question" menu button at the top of the screen and you'll be given a basic form to fill out. Once the question is created, it will immediately start showing up in search results.
    <h4>Adding Recommended Search Terms</h4>
    If you scroll to the bottom on a Question Detail screen, you'll see a box for entering new recommendations. You can also tag recent search terms, and add them directly to the recommended list. Visitors to the website can also recommend search terms, so you will see this list grow even if no one in your office is actively managing it.

    <br/>
    <h3>Testing the FAQ</h3>
    Once you have some questions and answers entered into the system, it can be helpful to try out some searches and make sure the correct questions are showing up. This can be done from the "Test FAQ" page, or from the public website. The Test page does not incorporate any feedback.
